    "# Road Network and Travel Time Prediction from Satellite Imagery on a CPU\n",
    "-----\n",
    "Automated road network extraction from remote sensing imagery remains a significant challenge despite its importance in a broad array of applications. To this end, we explore road network extraction at scale with inference of semantic features of the graph, identifying speed limits and route travel times for each roadway. We call this approach City-Scale Road Extraction from Satellite Imagery (CRESI). See our [paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/papers/Van_Etten_City-Scale_Road_Extraction_from_Satellite_Imagery_v2_Road_Speeds_and_WACV_2020_paper.pdf) for further details on CRESI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Including estimates for travel time permits true optimal routing (rather than just the shortest geographic distance), which is not possible with existing remote sensing imagery based methods.  Such time-based routing is usually critical to most use cases, and can differ significantly from simple geometric routing (see figure below).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial details the steps required to extract road networks starting from raw satellite imagery on a local laptop (no GPU server required).  We also explore optimized routing techniques that apply these techniques to an example evacuation scenario in a previously unseen city.\n",

    "This notebook (Part 1) detailes how to prepare your CRESI environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "## 1. Prepare your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "### A. Install Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "CRESI runs inside [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started), so to get started ensure docker is installed and running on your machine. After installation, open the Docker Menu, navigate to Preferencees -> Resources, and ensure that available memory is at least 6 GB and 6+ CPU cores are available. Run the commands below in a terminal on your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "### B. Create the CRESI Docker Container\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B.1 Download CRESI from github\n",
    "\n",
    "Pull down the code to the destination of your choosing (e.g. ```cresi_dir```).  The commands in sections B.1 - B.4 should be executed in a terminal (we use Bash):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cresi_dir=/Users/avanetten/cosmiq/git/cresi2/\n",
    "git clone -b dev https://github.com/CosmiQ/cresi.git $cresi_dir\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B.2 Build the docker image\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the following command, which will take a few minutes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cresi_docker_dir=\"${cresi_dir}/docker/cpu/\"\n",
    "docker build -t cresi $cresi_docker_dir\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B.3. Create the docker container\n",
    "\n",
    " Ideally, we would like to access the docker image from this notebook, which requires opening a new terminal on your local machine. Entering the command below in a terminal will create a docker container named \"cresi_cpu.\" You can mount important directories with the -v option, and open ports with the -p option.  We will mount the CRESI code as ```/opt/cresi``` within the container:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run -it -v $cresi_dir:/opt/cresi -p 9111:9111 --ipc=host --name cresi_cpu cresi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The command above will create and attach the container, but if you need to re-attach the container due to a reboot, simply invoke ```docker attach cresi_cpu```.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B.4. Configure AWS CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial we will use public imagery and model weights from the [SpaceNet 5 Challenge](https://spacenet.ai/sn5-challenge/).  These weights and images are are part of the [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/spacenet/), and can be downloaded for free.  You will need an AWS account to access the data, and since the AWS CLI tool is installed within the docker container, simply execute:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "aws configure\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "in the docker container and enter your credentials.  You will now be able to download SpaceNet data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B.5. Launch jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step in creating the CRESI environment is to fire up a jupyter notebook in the docker container by executing the following in the docker terminal: \n",
    "```\n",
    "cd /opt/cresi/notebooks/dar_tutorial_cpu/\n",
    "jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --port=9111 --no-browser --allow-root &\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see something like the following: \n",
    "```\n",
    "[I 15:47:45.446 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /opt/cresi/notebooks/dar_tutorial_cpu\n",
    "[I 15:47:45.446 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:\n",
    "[I 15:47:45.446 NotebookApp] http://5e8rvd8136da:9111/?token=XXXXYYYY\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the token value (e.g. `XXXXYYYY`). To access  notebook, open a web browser on your local and simply visit:\n",
    "```\n",
    "http://localhost:9111/notebooks/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the token (e.g. `XXXXYYYY` above) to login.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are now accessing this notebook using the python kernel from within the docker container, and can proceed to Part 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "__For Part 2 of this tutorial, we assume that the notebook is using the docker kernel and is accessed via: http://localhost:9111/notebooks/__\n"
